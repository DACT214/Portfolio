        hello, this is my small website. I am an inspiring software engeneer in training.
        I am applying to be a part of Revatrue, and hopfully will be reciving a call from them in the near futrue.
        As I wait I am teaching myself new skills and problem solving diffrent issues on my own.
        This portfolio site is a small example of what I am capable of doing, and even smaller 
        of what I will be able to do. I am learning a lot each day and hopeully be more than capable for whatever 
        challenges are there to face in the work force. 
       </p>
       <p>
           Feel free to look around the site, and don't hesitate to critize and offer advice to make it look better.
           I appreciate all I can get.  
       </p>
